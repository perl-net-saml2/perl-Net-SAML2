  Same a version 0.60-TRIAL

0.60 -- Mon Sep 19 10:53:23 ADT 2022

  [ Significant Changes since 0.59 ]

  There are multiple potentially BREAKING CHANGES depending on how you
  have written your application.  Your application may need updates for
  this version.

  [BREAKING CHANGES]

  - Support multiple signing keys in the metadata.  This version attempts
  to ensure compatibility but the call to Net::SAML2::IdP->cert will return
  an array of certs for each 'use'.  It is, however, likely that there will
  only be one cert in the array.

  - Net::SAML2::Binding::SOAP was improved.  The call to
  Net::SAML2::Binding::SOAP->handle_request() now returns the XML whereas in
  the past it returned the certificate's subject and the xml as an array.
  This make it consistent with the Redirect and POST Bindings.

  - Net::SAML2::Binding::POST was also improved.  Previously the call to
  Net::SAML2::Binding::POST->handle_response() returned inconsistent results
  depending on whether a cacert was provided.  This version returns the XML
  of the decoded request.

  - The testapp required only changes related to the call to
  Net::SAML2::IdP->cert($use) that now returns an ARRAY.

  [Changes of note:]

  - Support multiple signing keys in the metadata.  This version attempts to
    ensure compatability but the call to Net::SAML2::IdP->cert will return an
    array of certs for each $use.  It is, however, likely that there will only
    be one cert in the array.

  - Redirects now validate the raw URI that is passed to the call.  It is
    assumed that the URI that your application has sent is unmodified from the
    response that the web server received.  lighttpd in particular normalizes
    the response and will break Redirects from Microsoft Azure
    (see lighttpd.conf in xt/testapp for a working configuration)

  - Net::SAML2::Binding::SOAP and Net::SAML2::Binding::POST were improved.

  - SAML trust anchors were implemented and the verification of the SAML
    response was improved.  It is possible to validate the response with
    subject, issuer or issuer_hash as anchors in addition to the cacert.
    Neither cacert nor anchors are required as long as the signature of
    the response is valid.  The cacert has not been required for the
    Redirect or SOAP binding so this treats SOAP the same.

  [Required Application Updates]

  - There were several changed to the test suite that will likely need to be
    made in your application:

  - To support metadata.xml containing multiple KeyDescriptors the call to
    Net::SAML2::IdP->cert($use) now returns an ARRAY.  As this is an helper
    function that is meant to allow you to pass the cert to another Net::SAML2
    call it was deemed low risk.  Your code may be unaffected.

  - The call to Net::SAML2::Binding::SOAP->handle_request() needs to be updated
    to reflect that it returns only the decoded XML not an array of the
    Certificate Subject and XML.  Depending how your application uses the
    response will determine whether changes are required.

  - The call to Net::SAML2::Binding::POST->handle_response() returned
    inconsistent results depending on whether a cacert was provided.  This
    version returns the XML of the decoded request.  Previously it returned
    either 1 for success or if a cacert was used, either "(verified) and the
    certificate Subject" or 0 if the certificate verification failed.

  - The lighttpd.conf for the testapp did require a change to prevent it from
    "normalizing" a SAML Logout Redirect.  There are contradictory RFCs
    concerning SAML and the "normalising" URIs.  If you use lighttpd in a SAML
    application with AZURE as your SAML IdP see
    [lighttpd.conf](https://github.com/perl-net-saml2/perl-Net-SAML2/commit/3855393eb454097e1e326a516a573f37ce3456a3#diff-8fd15aaa870fd2b9cda596bf3bb870ce2723ae412e55f0b653124b45d87e1bea)

  [Possible Impacts]

  - It is worth noting that the testapp (that implements a rudimentary Service
    Provider) included in the git repo did not require any changes to the
    application for this version.

  - While my setup tests against multiple IdPs I do not have a working SOAP
    IdP at present.

0.58 -- Fri Aug 12 16:25:59 ADT 2022

  [ Significant Changes since 0.57 ]

  You will want to test this release.  There are numerous changes and
  improvements but nothing that obviously breaks functionality.

  - Fix bug where NameID Format was an empty string and broke the
    constructor for the LogoutRequest in Net::SAML::SP logout_request.
  - Add tests for lowercase URL encoded data
    A potential change is upcoming, so we want to have tests to ack/nack
    the claims of that new change.
  - Enclose SOAP action in double quotes
  - Allow error URI to be a full fledged URI in Net::SAML::SP
  - The generated id is now 32 bytes of randomness instead of 16 bytes
    previously
  - SAML2 constants moved to URN::OASIS::SAML2
  - Make cacert optional in Net::SAML2::SP as it is only needed for the
    SOAP request call
  - Add Indexes to the assertion_consumer_service in Net::SAML::SP
    This allows you to later on ask for the default assertion service by
    using get_default_assertion_service().
  - Allow injecting own LWP::UserAgent to IdP new_from_url
  - When reading metadata we previously always provided a default NameID
    Format. We no longer do this, we only return the NameID format if it
    was provided by the metadata.
  - Make provider optional in Protocol::ArtifactResolve
    Previous versions supplied a default when as_xml was called, this
    default has been removed.
  - Optional parameters in Binding::Redirect
    You now need to supply less parameters when verifying the redirect
    request (SAMLResponse).
  - Optional attributes for NameID in LogoutRequest
    In order to respect the SAML specifications the NameQualifier and
    SPNameQualifier are omitted from the LogoutRequest. In case you need
    the NameQualifier and the SPNameQualifier you'll now need
    include_name_qualifier to be set in the constructor. When the NameID
    Format is urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameidformat:persistent, both
    become mandatory. For those who need to set the SPNameQualifier to
    be the Affiliation Group ID we have affiliation_group_id for you in
    the constructor.

0.27-TRIAL    03-Jul-2020

        Some overhaul of the Moose code and a couple of XML::Sig fixes
        as well as a fix to work with Perl 5.10 (Upgrade please upgrade)

        As a point of interest the external XML::Sig module has been updated
        and is now capable of replacing Net::SAML2::XML::Sig

0.25  Tue, 19 May 2020 23:40:26 GMT

      What happened to version v0.21 to v0.24?

      The version of the embeded XML::Sig was higher that that of Net::SAML2
      which causes some issues in packaging so this release simply skipped the
      versions 0.21 to 0.24.  Not much else to say

      Minor changes for the most part but a requested release based on the
      removal of XML::Cannonical.  In fact that could be the only functionality
      change present.
